# debian-packaging-mindmap
A mindmap of Debian packaging concepts, with links and notes.

This map is currently generated with Mindly and exported to several formats, so there is only data (no code) in this repository right now.

This map fits my mind. Feel free to change it and adapt it to yours if you like.
