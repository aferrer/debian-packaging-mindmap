			<outline text="dpkg-deb" _note="dpkg-deb is a package manipulation program that allows the user to, among other things, list the contents of a package, extract the files to a particular directory or extract the control information." />
			<outline text="Others">
				<outline text="Tasksel" _note="A task is a collection of several individual Debian packages all related to a specific activity. Tasks can be installed through the tasksel program or through aptitude.&#xA;&#xA;Typically, the Debian installer will automatically install the task associated with a standard system and a desktop environment. Also, depending on your selections throughout the installation process, tasks might be automatically installed in your system. For example, if you selected a language other than English, the task associated with it will be installed automatically too and if the installer recognises you are installing on a laptop system the laptop task will also be installed." />
				<outline text="Synaptic" _note="synaptic is a graphical package manager. Along with most of the features offered by aptitude, it also has a feature for editing the list of used repositories, and supports browsing all available documentation related to a package.&#xA;&#xA;http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/" />
				<outline text="Aptitude" _note="aptitude is a package manager for Debian GNU/Linux systems that provides a frontend to the apt package management infrastructure. aptitude is a text-based interface using the curses library. Actions may be performed from a visual interface or from the command-line.&#xA;&#xA;aptitude provides the functionality of apt-get, as well as many additional features.&#xA;" />
			</outline>
			<outline text="apt" _note="APT is the Advanced Package Tool, an advanced interface to the Debian packaging system which provides the apt-get and apt programs. It provides commandline tools for searching and managing packages, and for querying information about them, as well as low-level access to all features of the libapt-pkg library.&#xA;&#xA;FAQ: https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkgtools.en.html#s-apt&#xA;&#xA;man: https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/apt/apt.8.en.html" />

			<outline text="pool" _note="The pool directory contains the actual packages.&#xA;&#xA;The source code is distributed in the pool directory together with all the architecture-specific binary directories.&#xA;&#xA;Packages are structured in t&apos;he &quot;pool&quot; directory according to the name of the source package. To make this manageable, the pool is subdivided by section (`main&apos;, `contrib&apos; and `non-free&apos;) and by the first letter of the source package name. These directories contain several files: the binary packages for each architecture, and the source packages from which the binary packages were generated.">

		<outline text="Unstable" _note="sid or unstable is the place where most of the packages are initially uploaded.

	<outline text="Packages">
		<outline text="Priorities" _note="Each Debian package is assigned a priority by the distribution maintainers, as an aid to the package management system.&#xA;&#xA;https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html#s-priority">
			<outline text="Required" _note="Packages that are necessary for the proper functioning of the system.&#xA;&#xA;This includes all tools that are necessary to repair system defects. Should not be removed, as this can leave a system broken." />
			<outline text="Important" _note="Packages that should be found on any Unix-like system.&#xA;&#xA;Other packages which the system will not run well or be usable without will be here. There are no large applications here, they only constitute the bare infrastructure.&#xA;&#xA;" />
			<outline text="Standard" _note="Packages that are standard on any Linux system, including a reasonably small but not too limited character-mode system.&#xA;&#xA;This is what will be installed by default if users do not select anything else. Tools are included to be able to send e-mail, download files from FTP servers, a Python interpreter, some server software like OpenSSH and Exim and some common generic documentation.&#xA;&#xA;" />
			<outline text="Optional" _note="Packages that you might reasonably want to install if you do not know what they are, or that do not have specialized requirements.&#xA;&#xA;This includes plots of applications.&#xA;&#xA;" />
			<outline text="Extra" _note="Packages that either conflict with others with higher priorities, are only likely to be useful if you already know what they are, or have specialized requirements that make them unsuitable for &quot;Optional&quot;." />
			<outline text="Essential" _note="Packages that are absolutely necessary for the proper functioning of the system. The package management tools will refuse to remove these." />
		</outline>
		<outline text="Status" _note="The package status seen with dpkg indicates what the user wants regarding the package.&#xA;&#xA;https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html#s-pkgstatus">
			<outline text="Remove" _note="The user wants the package removed, but does not want to remove any existing configuration file." />
			<outline text="Hold" _note="The user wants this package not to be processed, i.e. wants to keep the current version with the current status whatever that is." />
			<outline text="Purge" _note="The user wants the package to be removed completely, including its configuration files." />
			<outline text="Install" _note="The user wants the package installed or upgraded." />
			<outline text="Unknown" _note="The user has never indicated whether the package is wanted." />
		</outline>
		<outline text="Dependencies" _note="Dependencies are designed to indicate (in a single flag) the level at which Program A can operate independently of the existence of Program B on a given system.&#xA;&#xA;This information us declared in the package&apos;s control file.&#xA;&#xA;https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html#s-depends">
			<outline text="Suggests" _note="Package A suggests Package B if B contains files that are related to (and usually enhance) the functionality of A." />
			<outline text="Replaces" _note="Package A replaces Package B when files installed by B are removed and (in some cases) over-written by files in A." />
			<outline text="Pre-depends" _note="For some packages, dpkg will refuse even to unpack them until certain dependencies are resolved. Such packages are said to &quot;Pre-depend&quot; on the presence of some other packages." />
			<outline text="Provides" _note="Package A provides Package B when all of the files and functionality of B are incorporated into A. This mechanism provides a way for users with constrained disk space to get only that part of package A which they really need." />
			<outline text="Breaks" _note="Package A breaks Package B when both packages cannot be simultaneously configured in a system. The package management system will refuse to install one if the other one is already installed and configured in the system." />
			<outline text="Conflicts" _note="Package A conflicts with Package B when A will not operate if B is installed on the system. Most often, conflicts are cases where A contains files which are an improvement over those in B. &quot;Conflicts&quot; are often combined with &quot;replaces&quot;." />
			<outline text="Recommends" _note="Package A recommends Package B, if the package maintainer judges that most users would not want A without also having the functionality provided by B." />
			<outline text="Depends" _note="Package A depends on Package B if B absolutely must be installed in order to run A. In some cases, A depends not only on B, but on a version of B. In this case, the version dependency is usually a lower limit, in the sense that A depends on any version of B more recent than some specified version." />

				<outline text="postinst" _note="This script typically completes any required configuration of the package foo once foo has been unpacked from its Debian archive (&quot;.deb&quot;) file. Often, &apos;postinst&apos; scripts ask users for input, and/or warn them that if they accept default values, they should remember to go back and re-configure that package as needed. Many &apos;postinst&apos; scripts then execute any commands necessary to start or restart a service once a new package has been installed or upgraded." />
				<outline text="postrm" _note="This script typically modifies links or other files associated with foo, and/or removes files created by the package. " />
				<outline text="prerm" _note="This script typically stops any daemons which are associated with a package. It is executed before the removal of files associated with the package." />
				<outline text="preinst" _note="This script is executed before the package it belongs to is unpacked from its Debian archive (&quot;.deb&quot;) file. Many &apos;preinst&apos; scripts stop services for packages which are being upgraded until their installation or upgrade is completed (following the successful execution of the &apos;postinst&apos; script)." />

			<outline text="Source" _note="Source packages contain the source code and consist of a .dsc file describing the source package (including the names of the following files), a.orig.tar.gz file that contains the original unmodified source in gzip-compressed tar format and usually a .diff.gz file that contains the Debian-specific changes to the original source. The utility dpkg-source packs and unpacks Debian source archives.&#xA;&#xA;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html">
				<outline text="Build" _note="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html#s-sourcebuild" />
				<outline text="Installation" _note="To unpack a source package it is first necessary to configure the &quot;deb-src&quot; lines in apt&apos;s sources.list config file.&#xA;&#xA;Afterwards it&apos;s just:&#xA;&#xA;apt-get source foo" />
			</outline>
			<outline text="Virtual" _note="A virtual package is a generic name that applies to any one of a group of packages, all of which provide similar basic functionality.&#xA;&#xA;Formatge example, exim4 and sendmail both provide the functionality of a mail transport agent. They are therefore said to provide the virtual package &quot;mail-transport-agent&quot;. If either one is installed, then any program depending on the installation of a mail-transport-agent will be satisfied by the presence of this virtual package.&#xA;&#xA;If more than one package which provide the same virtual package is installed on a system, then system administrators can set one as the preferred package with the update-alternatives command.&#xA;&#xA;https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-customizing.en.html#s-diverse&#xA;&#xA;https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html#s-virtual" />
			<outline text="Binary" _note="Binary packages contain executables, configuration files, man/info pages, copyright information, and other documentation. These packages are distributed in a Debian-specific archive format and they are usually characterized by having a &apos;.deb&apos; file extension. Binary packages can be unpacked using the Debian utility dpkg&#xA;&#xA;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html" />
